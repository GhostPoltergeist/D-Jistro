# D-Jistro - Advanced Hand Tracking Tool

D-Jistro is an advanced hand tracking tool created with the help of Google Mediapipe, OpenCV, and pyttsx3. This program incorporates features such as advanced hand tracking and face tracking. The primary goal of D-Jistro is to detect specific landmarks and trigger text-to-speech notifications based on the position of the hand landmark number 8 relative to predefined coordinates in four different camps: Camp 1, Camp 2, Camp 3, and Camp 4.

## How it Works

D-Jistro is designed to detect and track hand and face landmarks using Google Mediapipe and OpenCV libraries. It utilizes the `pyttsx3` library to convert text into speech. Here's a high-level overview of how the program works:

1. **Hand and Face Tracking**: D-Jistro leverages Google Mediapipe and OpenCV to perform real-time hand and face tracking. The program captures the video feed from the camera and processes it to identify the positions of hands and faces in the frame.

2. **Landmark Detection**: The program detects and assigns landmark numbers to key points on the detected hand, such as fingertips, palm, and especially landmark number 8, which is crucial for the functionality of the system.

3. **Camp Coordination**: D-Jistro defines four camps in the video frame, each with its own specific coordinates. When landmark number 8 intersects with the coordinates of a particular camp, the program interprets it as a detection within that camp.

4. **Text-to-Speech Notification**: Upon detecting a landmark 8 intersection with a camp, D-Jistro utilizes `pyttsx3` to convert predefined text into speech. This spoken notification indicates that a detection has occurred in the corresponding camp.

## Usage

To run D-Jistro, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Install the required packages using `pip`:


2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP archive.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's directory.

4. Run the `DJistro.py` script:


5. The program will access your camera feed, and you should see the hand and face tracking in action.

## Camps and Landmark Numbers

The system divides the video frame into four distinct camps. Each camp has its own set of coordinates that trigger specific text-to-speech notifications when detected by landmark number 8. The landmark numbers for fingertip and palm positions are also used for advanced hand tracking functionality.

Here are the landmark numbers for the key points:
- Landmark 8: A crucial landmark used for camp detection.
- Landmark numbers for other hand points: Used for advanced hand tracking features.
- Landmark numbers for facial points: Used for face tracking features.

## About the Developer

D-Jistro is developed by Harold Edsel Cabaluna, an experienced programmer who previously worked as a Java Developer. He has now transitioned into pursuing a career as a Python Developer/Programmer. As the project is currently in beta and under development, Harold is continuously working to improve and expand its functionality.

## Disclaimer

Please note that as this program is still in beta, there might be bugs and limitations. The developer is actively working on enhancing and refining D-Jistro's performance and features. Feedback and suggestions are welcome to make this tool even better.
